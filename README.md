# Credit-Network
Introducing
"DebtFlow: An Intelligent Debt Settlement System (Credit
Network)", a powerful C++ application designed to simplify
complex group transactions using graph theory and optimization
algorithms.
This system allows users to:
• Register individuals and track debts seamlessly.
• Visualize current obligations and calculate net balances.
• Automate fair settlements using greedy algorithms.
• Compute optimal fund transfers via the Ford-Fulkerson maxflow technique.
• Discover the most cost-effective repayment paths with
Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.
Enhanced with real-time clock display, dynamic console visuals, and
an interactive menu-driven interface, DebtFlow brings clarity and
structure to debt management. Whether for roommates splitting
bills, friends sharing expenses, or micro-communities pooling
funds—this system ensures transparency, minimizes transaction
loops, and promotes financial harmony.
